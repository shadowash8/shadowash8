Hey there — I'm someone who like building, tinkering, and occasionally ranting about software, knowledge, and freedom. I don’t take myself too seriously, but I take what I *create* seriously.

I'm here to:
- Build useful, interesting, or just plain odd tools.

*🛠️ What I Build (and Why)*
- *Everyday tools* – Things that *just work*. Command-line utilities, scripts, and automation tools to simplify life.
- *Rices* – Crafting highly functional, *beautiful* environments.
- *Open knowledge* – Reformatting, translating, and archiving content that should be accessible to everyone.
- *Linux-y things* – Configs, dotfiles, and tweaks to make Linux (and Windows, when necessary) more powerful and personal.

*📌 Projects I’m proud of:*
- [[https://github.com/shadowash8/dotfiles][dotfiles]] – My dotfiles.
- [[https://github.com/shadowash8/ashdwm][ashdwm]] - My own dwm build.
- [[https://github.com/shadowash8/ashdwl][ashdwl]] - My own dwl build.
- [[https://github.com/shadowash8/.emacs.d][emacs]] - My emacs config.
- [[https://github.com/shadowash8/windots][windots]] - My windows setup.
- [[https://github.com/shadowash8/AutoVault][AutoVault]] – A simple app to store and manage information about your car(s).
- [[https://github.com/shadowash8/obsidian-aura][obsidian-aura]] – A clean, minimal, and customizable Obsidian theme.

*💭 Things I Believe:*
- Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) matters.
- Emacs ~ Vim
- Terminal > GUI (well... most of the time).
